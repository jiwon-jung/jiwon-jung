I earned my Ph.D. in the <a href="https://www.stat.purdue.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Department of Statistics</b></a> at Purdue University in 2024. I am a member of the research focus group <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/purdue-dsfi/home" target="_blank"> <b>Data Science in Finance and Industry </b></a> and am advised by <a href="https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~kiseop/" target="_blank"><b>Dr. Kiseop Lee</b></a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mxu/home?_ga=2.50296166.1710331856.1676529185-1031281822.1663908437" target="_blank"><b> Dr. Mengyi Xu</b></a>. 
     I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Statistics and a Master’s degree in Statistics, both from Seoul National University. Beyond finance and insurance research, my professional experience spans practical applications in the medical and industrial sectors. From 2019 to 2020, I worked as a researcher at Asan Medical Center, where I applied statistical methods to develop advanced cancer imaging analysis techniques. Subsequently, from 2022 to 2024, I served as a smart factory researcher at <a href="https://vivity.ai/" target="_blank"><b>Vivity AI</b></a>, contributing to cutting-edge projects that bridged academia and industry by integrating data-driven approaches into manufacturing processes. Currently, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University, where I actively enhance my research and teaching expertise in data science, time series analysis, and applied statistics.
